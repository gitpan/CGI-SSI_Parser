NAME
    CGI::SSI_Parser - Implement SSI for Perl CGI

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::SSI_Parser;

      $CGI::SSI_Parser::recursive = 1;

      fssi($filename);
      sssi($string);

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::SSI_Parser is used in CGI scripts for parsing SSI
    directives in files or string variables, and fully implements
    the functionality of apache's mod_include module.

    It is an alternative to famous Apache::SSI modules, but it
    doesn't require mod_perl. This is an advantage to those who are
    using public hosting services. There is a disadvantage, however
    - the module consumes much memory, and I don't recommend using
    it on heavy-loaded sites (currently it's being used on a site
    with 10000 hits, and I consider this as a limit). I hope to get
    rid of this disadvantage by the time the release comes out
    (currently it's beta).

  SSI Directives

    This module supports the same directives as mod_include. For
    methods listed below but not documented, please see
    mod_include's online documentation at
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_include.html .

    * config
    * echo
        This directive is not fully supported in current version.

    * exec
    * fsize
    * flastmod
    * include
    * printenv
    * set
        This directive is not supported in current version.

    * perl
        This directive is not supported in current version.

    * if
    * elif
    * else
    * endif
        These four directives are not supported in current version.

  Outline Usage

    First you need to load the CGI::SSI_Parser module:

      use CGI::SSI_Parser;

    You need to specify the following when processing of all nested
    directives is needed (default value - 0):

     $CGI::SSI_Parser::recursive = 1;

    To parse file or string you need to use:

      fssi($filename);
      sssi($string);

    The result is printed to STDOUT.

TO DO
    Full implementation of all SSI directives.

    Optimize memory consumption.
